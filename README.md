Token is a collaborative service that highlights the non-profit organizations of the city of Verviers to allow them to show what they do. The token is a virtual currency that has no monetary value. A service rendered equals a token received. It is also possible to put it in suspended token, as for coffees, and to allow someone who does not have the possibility of rendering a service to benefit from it. The idea is not to exclude anyone. This web application was developed with ReactJS.

We developed this web application for the Hackathon Citizens of Wallonia 2023 which happened in Charleroi where our team won the Prize for the Best Student Project.

This project was not finalized in this repository, but in <a href="https://github.com/FullCycleConceptaria/token">another one</a> to be able to keep a memory of what we produced during this Hackathon.
